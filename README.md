This project features a comprehensive Car Sales Data Analysis Dashboard developed using Tableau to provide actionable business intelligence on the automotive sales pipeline.
The dashboard analyzes key metrics such as Total Units Sold, Sales Revenue, and Profit Margins over time, allowing stakeholders to quickly assess organizational health and identify 
growth opportunities. Core visualizations include time-series analysis to detect seasonality and long-term trends, geographic maps to highlight regional performance disparities,
and product-focused breakdowns to determine the top-selling car makes and models by volume and revenue contribution. The goal of this analysis is to transform raw sales data into strategic insights,
enabling informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing campaign focus, and the optimization of pricing strategies across different dealerships or market segments.
